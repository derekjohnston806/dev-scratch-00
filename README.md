[![Code Climate](https://lima.codeclimate.com/github/derekjohnston806/dev-scratch-00/badges/gpa.svg)](https://lima.codeclimate.com/github/derekjohnston806/dev-scratch-00)

### Repository Description
A place to get familiar with some of the technologies I'm using
in some of my projects. In this scratchpad I'll be working with React Native
and Node.js. I'll also be exploring unit and integration testing with
Jest and Appium. For completion's sake, I'll connect this repository to
Code Climate for quality control and Travis-CI for continuous integration.
